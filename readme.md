TODO:
Drop a pin on the map for every earthquake
Change the color of the pin for the magnitude (add the icon info in the data structure)
Add details about the quake to the pins (May need to drop the "markers" directive for the "marker" directive + ng-repeat
Add a circle directive that takes a radius (like rectangle)
Add a switch for clustering
